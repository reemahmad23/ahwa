## ðŸŽ¯ Design & SOLID Principles

This project applies **core OOP concepts** and at least **three SOLID principles**:

- **Encapsulation**  
  Implemented in the `Order` class (private fields with public getters and controlled mutation via `markCompleted`).

- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**  
  Used in the `Drink` hierarchy (`Tea`, `TurkishCoffee`, `HibiscusTea`).  
  The UI and business logic treat drinks abstractly as `Drink`, while concrete types define their own `price` and `displayName`.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
  Each class has one reason to change:  
  - Entities (`Order`, `Drink`) hold data.  
  - `OrderRepository` handles persistence.  
  - `ReportService` handles reporting.  
  - Use-cases wrap domain actions.  
  - Managers handle UI state.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
  The app is open to extension but closed to modification.  
  For example, adding a new `Drink` subclass or new report doesnâ€™t require changing existing consumers.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
  High-level modules (use-cases, services, managers) depend on abstractions (`OrderRepository`) rather than concrete implementations.  
  The `InMemoryOrderRepository` is injected at app startup.
